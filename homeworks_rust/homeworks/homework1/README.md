Q: Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.
Consider:
1. What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
2. How could people cheat ?
3. How could you prevent them from cheating ?

A: A decentralized version of a game like Monopoly, without relying on software hosted on a central server, would require careful consideration of functionality, potential cheating methods, and anti-cheating measures. Here's an outline based on these considerations:

### Essential Pieces of Functionality

1. **Distributed Ledger for Game State:**
   - Use a blockchain or similar distributed ledger to record and update the game state.
   - Each player's moves, transactions, property ownership, and money balance would be logged on the ledger.

2. **Consensus Mechanism:**
   - Implement a consensus algorithm (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) to validate moves and ensure all players agree on the game state.
   - This ensures that all players have the same view of the game at any given time.

3. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Utilize smart contracts to automate rules and enforce game mechanics.
   - For example, when a player lands on a property, a smart contract could automatically handle the transaction of buying the property or paying rent.

4. **P2P Communication:**
   - Enable peer-to-peer communication among players for real-time interaction.
   - Use decentralized communication protocols to exchange messages and updates.

5. **Identity and Authentication:**
   - Employ decentralized identity solutions (e.g., self-sovereign identity) to ensure players are who they claim to be and prevent duplicate identities.

### Potential Cheating Methods

1. **Manipulating the Ledger:**
   - Players might attempt to alter the ledger to reflect fraudulent game states or transactions.

2. **Sybil Attacks:**
   - Players could create multiple identities to gain an unfair advantage.

3. **Collusion:**
   - Two or more players could collude to manipulate the game state or transactions to their advantage.

4. **Tampering with P2P Messages:**
   - Intercepting or tampering with P2P communication to alter game updates.

### Preventing Cheating

1. **Immutable Ledger:**
   - Use a blockchain to ensure that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered.
   - Cryptographic hashing can secure the integrity of the game state.

2. **Consensus Protocols:**
   - Implement robust consensus protocols to validate moves and game updates.
   - These protocols should make it computationally infeasible for a single player to alter the game state unilaterally.

3. **Sybil Attack Mitigation:**
   - Use proof-of-identity mechanisms or require stake (in-game assets or tokens) to participate, making it costly to create multiple identities.
   - Limit the influence of any single player or set of players over the consensus process.

4. **Smart Contract Audits:**
   - Ensure smart contracts are thoroughly audited and tested to prevent exploits.
   - Regularly update and patch smart contracts to address any discovered vulnerabilities.

5. **Encrypted P2P Communication:**
   - Employ end-to-end encryption for P2P messages to prevent tampering and eavesdropping.
   - Use cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of messages.

6. **Transparent Game State:**
   - Make the game state publicly viewable to all players, ensuring transparency.
   - Allow players to verify the correctness of transactions and moves.

### Summary
A decentralized Monopoly game would need a robust system of distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and secure communication protocols to function effectively and prevent cheating. Ensuring the integrity and fairness of the game would rely on immutable records, transparent operations, and strong cryptographic techniques to secure player interactions and game state updates.

Q: Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?

A: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. They differ significantly from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of their design, control, and underlying principles. Here are some points to consider regarding CBDCs and their impact on decentralization and the adoption of other cryptocurrencies:

### Centralization vs. Decentralization

**CBDCs:**
- **Centralized Control:** CBDCs are controlled and issued by central banks, meaning they are inherently centralized. This centralization allows for greater control over monetary policy, regulation, and tracking of transactions.
- **Regulation and Oversight:** The centralization of CBDCs allows for tighter regulation and oversight, which can help prevent illegal activities and provide consumer protection.
- **Stability:** CBDCs aim to provide a stable and reliable digital currency backed by the government, potentially offering a safer alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies.

**Cryptocurrencies:**
- **Decentralized Control:** Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are typically decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity. This decentralization is a key feature that appeals to many users seeking independence from government control.
- **Innovation and Experimentation:** The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies has led to significant innovation and experimentation within the space, fostering the development of new technologies and applications.

### Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption

**Potential Benefits:**
- **Increased Familiarity:** The introduction of CBDCs might increase public familiarity and comfort with digital currencies in general, potentially lowering barriers to the adoption of other cryptocurrencies.
- **Integration and Infrastructure:** The development of infrastructure for CBDCs, such as digital wallets and payment systems, could also support the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing necessary tools and frameworks.

**Potential Hindrances:**
- **Regulatory Pressure:** The launch of CBDCs might lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of other cryptocurrencies, potentially hindering their adoption and use.
- **Competition:** CBDCs could be seen as direct competitors to decentralized cryptocurrencies, potentially drawing users away due to their stability, government backing, and perceived safety.

### Overall Impact

The impact of CBDCs on the adoption of other cryptocurrencies will likely depend on several factors, including how they are implemented, the regulatory environment, and public perception. While CBDCs are a move towards a more digital financial system, they do not align with the principles of decentralization that underpin many cryptocurrencies. Instead, they represent a form of digital centralization. Whether they help or hinder the adoption of other cryptocurrencies will depend on how the broader financial ecosystem evolves and how users balance the benefits of centralization (e.g., stability and regulation) with the benefits of decentralization (e.g., privacy and independence).
